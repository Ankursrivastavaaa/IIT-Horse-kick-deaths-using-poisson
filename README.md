# IIT-Horse-kick-deaths-using-poisson

Model the horse kick deaths using the Poisson distribution with different parameters for each
of the corps. Learn Poisson distribution parameters for each of the corps using first 13 years
of data and make predictions on remaining 7 years and compute the RMSE of predictions for
each of the corps.
1. Use maximum likelihood estimation to learn the parameters.
2. Use maximum aposteriori estimation to learn the parameters
a. Assume appropriate prior distribution over parameters and justify your assumption
b. Plot prior, likelihood and posterior and provide your observations in terms of mode
of the distributions for corps 2, 4 and 6.
